# Color schemes with SASS
It is an exercice to improve my skills in SASS (SCSS syntax)

I create a stylesheet for a website with different color schemes using variables. Using variables to define the main color, background color, and text color for each scheme. Practice switching between color schemes by changing the variable values.
